# Package log

## Overview
The log package provides a unified logging API that abstracts the underlying logging implementation. It supports multiple logging levels and integrates with monitoring tools for comprehensive log management.

## Key Components
- Logging Functions: Methods to log various levels of messages.
- Configuration Options: Set output format, destinations, and more.
- Integration Hooks: Connect with external monitoring and error reporting services.

## Usage Example
~~~go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/mercor/payment-service/pkg/log"
)

func main() {
	log.Infof("Application started")
	fmt.Println("Logging initialized")
}
~~~

## Notes
